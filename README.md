# RepairX

An immutable ledger of automotive and vehicle repairs. Estimate your costs and share data anonymously to a ledger.

## Concept




## Structure

* `client/` - client side code (website) for the repairx project
* `server/` - server side code (ledger recording and querying logic) for repairx

## Building and running the project

From the `server` folder:
<pre>
    yarn && yarn start
</pre>

From the `client` folder:
<pre>
    yarn && yarn start
</pre>

The app should now be running on port 8000, with the server responding on port 8001.
